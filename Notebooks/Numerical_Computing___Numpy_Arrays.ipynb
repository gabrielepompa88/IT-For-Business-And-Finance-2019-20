    "\n",
    "- **Mathematics**: an array is a sequence of numbers of the same type (Naturals, Rationals, Reals,...). It can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a 1-dimensional vector $v$. That is, the sequence of elements indexed by the one integer $i$;\n",
    "    - a 2-dimensional matrix $M$. That is, the sequence of elements indexed by the couple of integers $(i,j)$;\n",
    "    - a N>2-dimensional tensor $T$. That is, the sequence of elements indexed by n-tuple of n integers $(i_1, \\cdots, i_n)$. (*)\n",
    "    \n",
    "(*) Feel lost? Ok, no problem. Let's make an example with a 3-dimensional Tensor. So, if $N=3$, a 3-dimensional sequence of numbers can be visualized as a  _cube_ of numbers indexed by the 3 indexes $(i,j,k)$ where indexes $i$ and $j$ run along _height_ (rows axes) and _width_ (columns axes) of the cube, respectively. While index $k$ runs along the depth (say the _pages_ axes) of the cube. Therefore, each page is distinguished by the value of index $k=0,1,2,...$, whereas numbers on the same page differ by the values of $(i,j)$ indexes (yes, you can think each page as a matrix of numbers). For example, the $\\color{red}{\\text{red 1}}$ in the front page has indexes $(i,j,k) = (3,2,0)$, wherease the three $\\color{green}{\\text{green 2}}$ on the bottom right corner have share same $i=4$ and $j=4$ indexes and differ by the value of $k=0$ (front-page), $k=1$ (second page) and $k=2$ (back page).

Moreover, being a _sequence,_ translates into the fact that consecutive items are stored in consecutive portions of memory, which are thus easily to be indexed and therefore quicker to be accessed. \n"
