# EXAMS <a name="exam_info"></a>

For additional informations see _Exams_ section of [Moodle page for IT for Business and Finance class](https://elearning.unisi.it/course/view.php?id=3326)

_General Informations_

On the exam date, at the beginning of the exam time window ([next exam: Monday March 15th, 2021 at 10:00, Rome time](https://elearning.unisi.it/mod/assign/view.php?id=146803), you will find attached an exam sheet to the specific exam activity section (next: [March Term](https://elearning.unisi.it/mod/assign/view.php?id=146803);
The exam sheet is a Jupyter Notebook with questions/exercises and empty Code cells for your answers. A Jupyter Notebook is a file with .ipynb extension. It is the kind of file on which lecture notes have been delivered so far, so you should be already familiar with this (see Prerequisites);

_Operational Instructions_

Answer to the questions on the exam sheet offline, on your personal computer, following these operational instructions:
- download the exam sheet on your personal computer;
- move the exam sheet downloaded to the Exams sub-folder of your class folder (IT_For_Business_And_Finance_2019_20\Exams); (see Prerequisites)
- open the exam sheet using the Jupyter Notebook app of the Anaconda Navigator (see Prerequisites);
- answer to the exam questions directly on the exam sheet;
- once done, save and download (as Notebook) the exam sheet completed;
- before the end of the exam time window: upload the exam sheet as an attachement, using the dedicated upload form. 

_Prerequisites_

These are the prerequisites you must fulfill before taking the exam:
You should have already the latest updated version of the class folder IT_For_Business_And_Finance_2019_20 on your personal computer.
You should have the Anaconda Navigator installed on your personal computer.
Using the Jupyter Notebook application of the Anaconda Navigator, you should be able to (these are all step you should have already be well familiar with, if you have followed the class):
- navigate to the directory containing the notebook you want to open,
- open the notebook, 
- making changes to it, 
- run it,
- save it,
- download it (as Notebook .ipynb file).

As per exam, it will be assumed that all of you satisfy these prerequisites. Should you still be missing some of those, please follow these instructions on how to work this class: https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20/blob/master/How-to-work-this-class.md and please do let me know if you need assistance.

_About the exam_

- Exam questions can ask you to write code or answer theoretical questions.
- Comment extensively your code. A well written and commented code which does not run is more valuable (and will be graded accordingly) than a poorly written and not-commented code that does run. 
- You can use whatever you want to do the exam (textbook, books, internet, etc.)
- In the exam sheet you will find further instructions to be followed. In particular: even if the exam sheet will be unique for everybody, you will be asked to use your unisi identification number unisi_id (e.g. 589160) in several ways to make it unique (for example: you might be asked to set the lenght of a NumPy array to the second digit (e.g. 8) of your unisi_id, or to input the full unisi_id as a seed for a random number generation, like: np.random.seed(589160) ) 

_Extra_

Upon suggestions, you may do some extra work and prepare a financial project . The following rules apply:
  - The project is not compulsory and, in particulary, does not substitute the Exam;
  - The project might be helpful for exam preparation and, in particular, for your future to show off your ability (to recruiters and/or hiring managers);
  - The project shall take the form of the development of a personal GitHub repository, on the footprints of the class one;
  - I will be happy (write me to take an appointment) to discuss with you project topics of mutual interest and to help you with the project;

For any question, I’m here to help you (gabriele.pompa@unisi.it, Skype: **gabriele.pompa**)

- **Lesson 13 (01/04)**:  `yfinance` API: installation, Yahoo! Finance tickers [lookup page](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/). Basic usage: get market and meta data for one (`yf.Ticker()`) and multiple (`yf.Tickers()`) security/s, mass download of market data (`yf.download()`).

  - Exercises: practice with `yfinance` API: 
    - download ticker data for "General Electric Company" stock from Jan 1st, 1985;
    - save its "Close" price Pandas Series as a 'GE_Close_Price.csv' file in `/Data` folder;
    - open both the 'Securities_Close_Price_Dataset.csv' and the, just saved 'GE_Close_Price.csv';
    - integrate GE Close price data with other data as an additional column 'GE' of the `closePrice` DataFrame in 'Securities_Close_Price_Dataset.csv' file;
    - save the extended `closePrice` DataFrame as 'Extended_Securities_Close_Price_Dataset.csv' file.

- **Lesson 14 (06/04)**: Data Analysis: first look at DataFrame (`.head()`, `.tail()` and `.plot()` methods), buy-and-hold portfolio, summary statistics, returns: simple (`.pct_change()` method) and log-returns (`.shift()` method), resampling (`.resample()` method), graphical test of normality (Normal fit, Q-Q plot), rolling statistics (`.rolling()` method), rolling correlation matrix (not for exam), SPX/VIX inverse relationship analysis: OLS regression (`np.polyfit()` function), correlation analysis.

  - Exercises: 
    - practice on the Data Analysis (summary statistics, returns, resampling, rolling statistics etc.) topics covered using the 'Extended_Securities_Close_Price_Dataset.csv' file, which includes closing prices for the 'GE' Stock;
    - In particular: do the graphical tests of normality (histogram, normal fit and Q-Q plot) on the 'GE' stock. Do this in a script file named 'GE_Returns_Graphical_Normality_Tests.py' and save it in the 'Scripts' folder (_Hint:_ you can modify [SPX_Returns_Graphical_Normality_Tests.py](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20/blob/master/Scripts/SPX_Returns_Graphical_Normality_Tests.py) which you can find in the 'Scripts' folder already)
